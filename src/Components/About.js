     <h1 className="fs-1 fw-bold fst-italic">Hi there,</h1>

<p className="fs-5">My name is Tuscanny and Im a <span className="fw-bold">Web Designer</span> and <span className="fw-bold">Developer.</span> I often wonder how ideas and designs come together to make things that are practical, elegant and thechnically impressive. I enjoy challenging myself to make one-of-a-kind art and web applications; and I believe that combining my talents in this way is a true test of my natual inclanations and talents. Ive been drawing and painting for as long as I can remember and In recent years, my creative curiosities have expanded to Graphic Design and Front End Software Development.</p>

<p className="fs-5">My approach to design is minimal and concise. I believe that the best ideas are presented simply, with little need for explanation. Clean and minimal designs intrigue me, and I find it a challenge to subtract from my work as much as I can until I am left with what I concider to be the 'Core Idea' or, what is most nessesary to effectivly communicate a concept. Minimal applications with robust inner workings really exite me.</p>
