     <h1 className="fs-1 fw-bold fst-italic">Hi there,</h1>

<p className="fs-5">My name is Tuscanny and Im a <span className="fw-bold">Web Designer</span> and <span className="fw-bold"> Software Developer.</span> I often wonder how ideas and designs come together to make things that are practical, elegant and thechnically impressive. I enjoy challenging myself to create one-of-a-kind designs and web applications that are unique and break the mold of conventional website aesthetics. Additionally, building crisp, clean and profesional websites is fun for me and a dicipline that inspires my imagination in my personal work projects.</p>

<p className="fs-5"><span className="fw-bold">My approach to design</span> is minimal and concise. I believe that the best ideas are presented simply, with little need for further explanation. Clean and minimal designs intrigue me intellectually, and I find it a challenge to subtract from a piece as much as I can until I am left with what I concider to be the 'Core Idea' or; what is most nessesary to effectivly communicate a concept. Minimal applications with robust inner workings really exite me.</p>


<h1 className="fs-1 fw-bold fst-italic">About this project!</h1>
<p className="fs-5">Meet Hugh, one of my favorite ongoing projects, and personal assistant chatbot. I started building Hugh as soon as I started learning <span className="fw-bold">HTML, CSS </span>and <span className="fw-bold"> JavaScript</span> a few years ago. Over time Ive reworked and rebuilt Hugh many times, and in this current iteration, Ive decided to make this project my portfolio website.</p>

<p className="fs-5">This version of Hugh is built using <span className="fw-bold">React Js, Bootstrap </span>and <span className="fw-bold">Framer Motion</span> (also prototyped in <span className="fw-bold">Figma</span>). It has always been a primary concern when building Hugh, to make the user interface 'toy-like' while expanding the complexity of application under the hood. </p>
