# Hugh ChatBot Version 3

Meet Hugh, one of my favorite ongoing projects, and personal assistant chatbot. I started building Hugh as soon as I started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript a few years ago. Over time Ive reworked and rebuilt Hugh many times, and in this current iteration, Ive decided to make this project my portfolio website.

This version of Hugh is built using React Js, Bootstrap and Framer Motion (also prototyped in Figma). It has always been a primary concern when building Hugh, to make the user interface 'toy-like' while expanding the complexity of application under the hood.

## Why 'Hugh'?

One of the first things that I learned how to do when I first started working on this project was to dynamically change the background color of the webpage by entering color names into the input field. This very facinated to me and really got me going! It was such a magical idea to be able to effect a program with text in such a way! This is where the name 'Hue' derives from. Somwhere along the line, it was decided to change 'Hue' to 'Hugh'.

The initial functionality of Hugh was to change into all of these fun colors when the user types in 'red' or 'blue' or 'green' etc.. Simple enough right? Hahaha, this was very cool to me at the time; and honestly, it still is! Among the many things you can communicate to Hugh, you may still ask to change into all sorts of fun colors. This is a simple request for this program, but it is a nod the humble foundations that originally started this project in the beginning of development.

## This is a project that is constantly updated

Im always adding things to improve the conversational abilities of this chatbot and improve the experience of anyone that may use it. Previous versions of Hugh include capabilities that are missing in this current version; and I am working on incorperating those elements while adding compleatly new elements as well. Whenever I learn something new while coding other projects, I try my best to incorperate that new knowlage into this project; not only to make Hugh better, but also as a way of practicing what Ive learned. Of course, each adddition to Hugh is implmented carefully and with a level of nuance.

### This current version

This current version has been the longest running version of Hugh. It is also the most stable. I will build out this version until I require a need for a database. Once the need for a proper backend enviornment arises, I will begin version 4.
